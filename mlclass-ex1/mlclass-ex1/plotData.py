    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: Plot the training data into a figure using the
    #               "figure" and "plot" commands. Set the axes labels using
    #               the "xlabel" and "ylabel" commands. Assume the
    #               population and revenue data have been passed in
    #               as the x and y arguments of this function.

    # fig = plt.figure() # open a new figure window
